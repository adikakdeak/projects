Summary:
- Imported the data from 15 different files. Prepared data by following steps such as handling missing values, performing feature check, extracting sample, performing encoding and scaling, using NumPy and Pandas Python packages.
- Explored the columns and relationship between columns using pie charts, bar graphs, scatter plots and stacked bar graphs. Plotted these charts using Matplotlib Python package.
- Performed feature selection and hyper-parameter tuning using pipe utility from Scikit-Learn Python package.
- Implemented k-Nearest Neighbour and Decision Tree classifiers on the prepared data using tuned parameters and features of highest importance.
- Evaluated performance for all classifiers using metrics such as AUC score, confusion matrix, precision, recall, accuracy and f1-score. Computed these metrics using metrics utility from Scikit-Learn Python package
