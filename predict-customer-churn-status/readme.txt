Summary:
- Prepared data by following steps such as handling missing values, performing feature check, extracting sample, performing encoding and scaling, using NumPy and Pandas Python packages.
-	Explored the data using pie charts and grouped bar charts. Plotted these charts using Matplotlib Python package.
-	Performed feature selection and hyper-parameter tuning using pipe utility from Scikit-Learn Python package.
-	Implemented k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Random Forests and Na√Øve Bayes classifiers on the prepared data using tuned parameters and features of highest importance.
-	Evaluated performance for all classifiers using metrics such as AUC score, confusion matrix, precision, recall, accuracy and f1-score. Computed these metrics using metrics utility from Scikit-Learn Python package.
